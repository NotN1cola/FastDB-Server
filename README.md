# FastDB

## Description

FastDB is a simple database that can be used directly with tcp requests. The project is entirely developed in Python and uses external libraries.

## Install

First thing, download the project by typing:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/NotN1cola/FastDB-Server.git
```
After that, just open a command line on the same folder where FastDB
is located, and type:
```bash
  python3 FastDB.py createsuperadmin
```
Doing that, it will give you a superAdmin token, be careful to who
gets this token, as it has permission to all the exsting databases.
Then, start the server by typing:
```bash
  python3 FastDB.py startserver
```
You're welcome!
